	"summary": "Important: redis:5 security update",
	"details": "Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* redis: Heap buffer overflow in HyperLogLog triggered by malicious client (CVE-2019-10192)\n\n* redis: Stack buffer overflow in HyperLogLog triggered by malicious client (CVE-2019-10193)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
