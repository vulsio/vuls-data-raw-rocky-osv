Since \"less\" does not\nread the entire input file at startup, it also starts more quickly than ordinary\ntext editors.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* less: missing quoting of shell metacharacters in LESSCLOSE handling\n(CVE-2022-48624)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
