	"summary": "Low: redis:6 security, bug fix, and enhancement update",
	"details": "Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: redis (6.2.7). (BZ#1999873)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* redis: Code injection via Lua script execution environment (CVE-2022-24735)\n\n* redis: Malformed Lua script can crash Redis (CVE-2022-24736)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Rocky Linux 8.7 Release Notes linked from the References section.",
