	"summary": "Moderate: rsync security and enhancement update",
	"details": "The rsync utility enables the users to copy and synchronize files locally or across a network. Synchronization with rsync is fast because rsync only sends the differences in files over the network instead of sending whole files. The rsync utility is also used as a mirroring tool.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* zlib: heap-based buffer over-read and overflow in inflate() in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field (CVE-2022-37434)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nAdditional Changes:\n\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Rocky Linux 8.7 Release Notes linked from the References section.",
