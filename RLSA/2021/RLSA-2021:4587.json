(This is the default.)\n\"-Wbidirectional=none\", which turns the warning off.\n\"-Wbidirectional=any\", which warns about any use of bidirectional characters.\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.",
